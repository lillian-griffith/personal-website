			Lillie Griffith is a fourth-year student at Georgia Southern University and is pursuing a degree in Information Technology with minors in Cyber Security and English. Her interest in technology began in high school, where she took elective courses that taught her HTML, CSS, and Java. Since then, she has continued to refine her skills through her classes and her job as a student technician in the IT Service & Delivery Department at Georgia Southern.</p>
			<p>In addition to Lillie’s interest in technology, she has always had an affinity for reading and writing. Naturally, she decided to pick up a minor in English, which has not only made her education at Georgia Southern that much more enjoyable, it has improved her communication skills tenfold.</p>
			<p>Lillie enjoys being busy, so in addition to working as a student tech, she is a TA for the IT Department’s Database Design & Implementation course, a nanny during the summer, and occasionally works retail as well. These different jobs have taught her valuable customer service and time management skills that Lillie believes she will carry with her for the rest of her life.</p>
