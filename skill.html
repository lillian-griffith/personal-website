				<p>Lillie spends most of her time outside with her dog, Tatum. She takes him to the dog park every day, but also enjoys running and hiking with him by her side.</p>
				<p>When not with her dog, Lillie can be found in the kitchen cooking for her friends and family. She enjoys the feelings of hospitality and togetherness that come with a home-cooked meal.</p>
				<p>She also enjoys a reading in her down time. She most enjoys novels from the Modernism and Post-Modernism periods, such as Ernest Hemmingway's <i>A Farwell to Arms</i> and Raymond Carver's <i>What We Talk About When We Talk About Love</i>.</p>
